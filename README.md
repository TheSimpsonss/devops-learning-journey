# 🚀 DevOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal DevOps learning repository! This is a daily journal of my deep-dive into the world of DevOps — covering everything from Linux fundamentals to full-scale CI/CD pipelines on the cloud. I’ll be updating this regularly with concepts, notes, hands-on implementations, real-world projects, and architectural diagrams.

> “The best way to learn is to build. This repo is where I learn, break, fix, and grow.”

## 🎯 Objective of This Repository

This repository is built to serve as a *complete, hands-on DevOps roadmap* — from foundational concepts to real-world implementation. It is designed for:

- 🚀 Beginners who want a structured path into DevOps
- 🛠 Engineers transitioning from development/sysadmin to DevOps roles
- 📈 Practitioners aiming to level up with modern tooling and cloud-native practices

You’ll not only learn *how* tools work — but also *why* they matter and *how to integrate* them in real-world pipelines.

---

## 📌 Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of this journey, you will:

- ✅ Understand the DevOps culture, practices, and lifecycle  
- ✅ Use Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration  
- ✅ Set up and manage CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins & GitHub Actions  
- ✅ Containerize applications with Docker  
- ✅ Orchestrate workloads with Kubernetes  
- ✅ Write Infrastructure as Code using Terraform  
- ✅ Configure systems using Ansible  
- ✅ Monitor infrastructure and applications using Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK  
- ✅ Deploy production-ready apps on AWS Cloud
